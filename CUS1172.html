   <!-- Bio Section -->
   <p>My name is Ramon Guzman-Jimenez. I'm a senior student pursuing my Computer Science bachelor's degree at 
      <span style="color: red;">St. John's University</span>. I currently have a high school diploma from graduating from Cardinal Hayes High School. I currently have no college degrees. 
      I have experience with Java and am wanting to learn Python. I enjoy listening to music and watching TV shows/anime. 
      I don't believe I can pick out a favorite TV show or song, since it's always been hard for me to choose favorites, 
      but one of my favorite more recent albums to listen to has been 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCcwCv3G1FQ&list=OLAK5uy_nt1Nw4wT6I7VlzNknxTiIz3hfED0ttO8Q" target="_blank">
         Tyler The Creator's Chromokopia
      </a>, and my favorite movie to watch as of recent times is Bullet Train (2022).
